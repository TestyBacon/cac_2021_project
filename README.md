# cac_2021_project

This is our CAC 2021 project.


## Main.dart inside the lib folder

[This should show you how to use github in visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github)

## I think I get it now

1) Create github account
2) [Install github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3) Sign in on github desktop
4) In Github Desktop: Current Repository > Add > Clone Repository > URL
5) Type in TestyBacon/cac_2021_project and enter a local path to save the file to
6) [Install github pull requests on visual studio code](vscode:extension/GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
7) [Install github repositories on visual studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.remotehub)
8) Sign in to github on VS code
9) In VS code: File > Open folder > Find the local path you saved the repository to
10) Open lib/main.dart
11) Finished?

## Weird Terminology stuff
Repo = Repository: basically the folder for our stuff

Remote Repository: The repository that is saved on github

Local Repository: The repository that is saved on your computer

Clone: Copies the repo from github and saves a local copy to your computer

Branch: Kinda like a new copy of the repo where you can make changes but without affecting other people's work. 
**ALWAYS WORK ON A BRANCH**

main: The main branch. All branches stem from it. Making a change to main affects all branches

Merge: Merges a branch to the main branch (Technically you can branch a branch and merging the second branch will merge to the first branch)

Fork: Copies someone else's repo to your github. The fork, AFAIK, is completely independent from the original. We don't need to fork

Staging changes: Declaring your local changes before committing them.

Push Commit: Takes the staged changes and uploads(?) the changes to the remote repo on github. You have to add a commit message. 

Pull Request: I think it means requesting to merge a branch to main.

Upstream/Downstream: Not sure, but I think downstream is from a remote repo -> local, and upstream is from local repo -> remote

Pull commit: Not sure, but I think it means taking upstream changes and saving them to the local repo
